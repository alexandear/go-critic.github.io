### Project overview

`go-critic` is a collection of checks that detect style, performance issues as well
as some common programming errors.

Project goals:
* Provide as much useful checks as possible. We're prototyping and experimenting here
* When specific check implementation is mature and proven useful, propose it's integration into other linter
* If good checker can't find a better home, it stays here

`go-critic` is open source and free (as in beer) software, licensed under [MIT license](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic/blob/master/LICENSE).
